''Oppenheimer'' was announced in September 2021. It is Nolan's first film not distributed by [[Warner Bros. Pictures]] since ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' (2000), due to his conflicts regarding the studio's simultaneous theatrical and [[Max (streaming service)|HBO Max]] release schedule.<ref name="Fleming 2021 l559">{{cite web | last=Fleming | first=Mike | title=Christopher Nolan Chooses Universal Pictures For His Film About J.

Pre-production began by January 2022, and filming took place from February to May. The cinematographer, [[Hoyte van Hoytema]], used a combination of [[IMAX]] 65&nbsp;mm and [[70 mm film|65&nbsp;mm large-format film]], including, for the first time, scenes in IMAX [[black-and-white]] [[film photography]]. As with many of his previous films, Nolan used extensive practical effects, with minimal [[compositing]].

''Oppenheimer'' premiered at [[Grand Rex|Le Grand Rex]] in Paris on July 11, 2023, and was theatrically released in the United States and the United Kingdom ten days later by [[Universal Pictures]]. Its concurrent release with Warner Bros.'s ''[[Barbie (film)|Barbie]]'' was the catalyst of the "[[Barbenheimer]]" phenomenon, encouraging audiences to see both films as a [[double feature]]. ''Oppenheimer'' grossed over $976 million worldwide, becoming the [[2023 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2023]], the highest-grossing World War II-related film, the highest-grossing biographical film and the [[List of highest-grossing R-rated films#Highest-grossing R-rated films|second-highest-grossing R-rated film]].

The recipient of  [[List of accolades received by Oppenheimer (film)|many accolades]], ''Oppenheimer'' won seven [[96th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Nolan, [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Murphy and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Downey. It also won five [[81st Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe Awards]] (including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Drama|Best Motion Picture – Drama]]) and seven [[77th British Academy Film Awards|British Academy Film Awards]] (including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]]), and was named one of the top ten films of 2023 by the [[National Board of Review]] and the [[American Film Institute]].

== Plot ==
{{Hatnote|While the film is shown in a [[nonlinear narrative]], the following is the chronological order of events that happen in the film.}}

In 1926, the 22-year-old doctoral student [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] grapples with anxiety and homesickness while studying experimental [[quantum physics]] under [[Patrick Blackett]] at the [[University of Cambridge]]. Oppenheimer clashes with Blackett and leaves him a poisoned apple but later retrieves it. Visiting scientist [[Niels Bohr]] advises Oppenheimer to study [[theoretical physics]] at the [[University of Göttingen]].

Oppenheimer completes his PhD and meets scientist [[Isidor Isaac Rabi]]. They later meet theoretical physicist [[Werner Heisenberg]] in Switzerland. Wanting to expand [[quantum physics]] research in the US, Oppenheimer teaches at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[California Institute of Technology]]. He marries [[Katherine Puening|Katherine "Kitty" Puening]], a biologist and ex-[[Communism|communist]], and has an intermittent affair with [[Jean Tatlock]], a troubled communist psychiatrist who later dies by suicide.{{Efn|Although Tatlock's death in reality was a suicide, the film implies that she was murdered, although it is not confirmed.}}

When [[Discovery of nuclear fission|nuclear fission is discovered]] in 1938 after the Germans succeed in splitting the atom, Oppenheimer realizes it can be weaponized. In 1942, during [[World War II]], US Army Colonel [[Leslie Groves]], the director of the [[Manhattan Project]], recruits Oppenheimer as the director of the [[Los Alamos Laboratory]] to develop an [[atomic bomb]]. Oppenheimer fears the [[German nuclear program during World War II|German nuclear research program]], led by Heisenberg, might yield a [[Thermonuclear weapon|fission bomb]] for the Nazis.

Oppenheimer assembles a team consisting of Rabi, [[Hans Bethe]], and [[Edward Teller]], and collaborates with the scientists [[Enrico Fermi]], [[Leo Szilard]], and [[David L. Hill]] at the [[University of Chicago]]. Teller's calculations reveal an atomic detonation could [[Effects of nuclear explosions#Fear of atmosphere ignition|destroy the world]]. After consulting with [[Albert Einstein]], and having Bethe do his own calculations on the matter, Oppenheimer concludes the chances are "near zero". Teller attempts to leave the project after his proposal to construct a [[hydrogen bomb]] is rejected, but Oppenheimer convinces him to stay.

After [[German Instrument of Surrender|Germany's surrender]] in 1945, some scientists question the bomb's relevance. Oppenheimer believes it would end the [[Pacific War|ongoing Pacific War]] and save lives. The [[Trinity (nuclear test)|Trinity test]] is successful, and President [[Harry S. Truman]] orders the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], resulting in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]]'s [[Surrender of Japan|surrender]]. Though publicly praised, Oppenheimer is guilt-ridden and haunted by the destruction and mass fatalities. After Oppenheimer expresses his remorse to Truman, the president berates him and dismisses his plea to cease further atomic development.

As an advisor to the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC), Oppenheimer's stance generates controversy, while Teller's hydrogen bomb receives renewed interest amidst the burgeoning [[Cold War]]. AEC Chairman [[Lewis Strauss]] resents Oppenheimer for publicly dismissing Strauss's concerns about exporting [[Radionuclide|radioactive isotopes]] and for recommending negotiations with the [[Soviet Union]] after the Soviets [[RDS-1|successfully detonate their own bomb]]. Strauss also believes that Oppenheimer denigrated him during a conversation Oppenheimer had with Einstein in 1947.

In 1954, wanting to eliminate Oppenheimer's political influence, Strauss secretly orchestrates [[Oppenheimer security hearing|a private security hearing]] before a Personnel Security Board concerning the renewal of Oppenheimer's [[Q clearance]], during which his loyalty to the United States is questioned. However, the hearing is a [[kangaroo court]]. Oppenheimer's past communist ties are raised and his associates' testimony is twisted against him, with Teller's being the most damaging. After Kitty delivers an impassioned defense of herself and her husband, the board no longer suspects Oppenheimer of disloyalty but still [[Revocation|revokes]] his clearance, thereby damaging his public image and limiting his influence on American nuclear policy.

In 1959, during Strauss's [[Advice and consent#United States|Senate confirmation hearing]] for [[United States Secretary of Commerce|Secretary of Commerce]], Hill unexpectedly testifies about Strauss's personal motives for engineering Oppenheimer's downfall. Strauss's nomination is narrowly voted down, enraging him. In 1963, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] presents Oppenheimer with the [[Enrico Fermi Award]]. A flashback reveals that Oppenheimer and Einstein's 1947 conversation had nothing to do with Strauss. Instead, the two discussed Oppenheimer's legacy, and Oppenheimer remorsefully expressed his fear that they had indeed started a [[Nuclear arms race|chain reaction]] that will [[Nuclear holocaust|destroy the world]].

[[File:KAI BIRD author photo by Stephen Frietch.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Kai Bird]] (pictured) and [[Martin J. Sherwin]] are the authors of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]]'s biography ''[[American Prometheus]]'' (2005), on which the film is based.]]
The director [[Sam Mendes]] was interested in adapting the 2005 Oppenheimer biography ''[[American Prometheus]]'' by [[Kai Bird]] and [[Martin J. Sherwin]]. After that project failed to materialize, the book was [[Option (filmmaking)|optioned]] by various filmmakers over the next fifteen years. The authors became pessimistic about a film adaptation. [[Oliver Stone]] declined an opportunity to direct, saying he "couldn't find my way to its essence".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ntim |first=Zac |date=August 1, 2023 |title=Oliver Stone Says He Once Turned Down An Oppenheimer Film Project & Calls Christopher Nolan's Film A "Classic" |url=https://deadline.com/2023/08/oliver-stone-oppenheimer-film-christopher-nolan-1235452328/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230831150216/https://deadline.com/2023/08/oliver-stone-oppenheimer-film-christopher-nolan-1235452328/ |archive-date=August 31, 2023 |access-date=August 31, 2023 |website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]}}</ref><ref name="Amsden 2023" /> In 2015, J.

=== Writing ===
Nolan became aware of Oppenheimer as a youth, after hearing the lyric "How can I save my little boy from Oppenheimer's deadly toy?" in the [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] song "[[Russians (song)|Russians]]" (1985).<ref name="Ebiri 2023" /> He was also inspired by his [[Nuclear anxiety|fears of nuclear holocaust]] throughout childhood, as he lived during the era of [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND) and the [[Greenham Common Women's Peace Camp|anti-nuclear protests]] in [[RAF Greenham Common]]. He felt that "while our relationship with that [nuclear] fear has ebbed and flowed with time, the threat itself never actually went away", and felt the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]] had caused a resurgence of nuclear anxiety.<ref name="Collin 2023" /> Nolan had also penned a script for a biopic of [[Howard Hughes]] approximately during the time of production of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'' (2004), which had given him insight on how to write a script regarding a person's life.<ref name="Overbye 2023" /> [[Emily Blunt]] described the ''Oppenheimer'' script as "emotional" and resembling that of a thriller, while also remarking that Nolan had "[[Trojan Horse|Trojan-Horsed]] a biopic into a thriller".<ref name="TotalFilm-23MAY26-OppenheimerLongest">{{Cite web |last=Maytum |first=Matt |date=May 26, 2023 |title=Christopher Nolan confirms Oppenheimer is his longest film yet |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/oppenheimer-runtime-christopher-nolan-total-film-interview/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230520090628/https://www.gamesradar.com/oppenheimer-runtime-christopher-nolan-total-film-interview/ |archive-date=May 20, 2023 |access-date=July 12, 2023 |website=[[Total Film]] |publisher=[[GamesRadar+]]}}</ref>{{Multiple image|perrow=3|total_width=380

Nolan began by trying to find the "thread that connected the quantum realm, the vibration of energy, and Oppenheimer's own personal journey" and sought to portray the difficulties in his life, particularly regarding his sex life.<ref name="Collin 2023" /> As such, Nolan wanted to candidly portray his affair with [[Jean Tatlock]].

Another critical moment of the film was the meeting in which President [[Harry S. Truman]] called Oppenheimer a "crybaby". Nolan wanted to convey the scene from Oppenheimer's perspective and felt it was a "massive moment of disillusion, a huge turning point [for Oppenheimer] in his approach to trying to deal with the consequences of what he'd been involved with", while also underscoring that it is a "huge shift in perception about the reality of Oppenheimer's perception".<ref name="Overbye 2023" /> He wanted to execute a quick tonal shift after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, desiring to go from the "highest triumphalism, the highest high, to the lowest low in the shortest amount of screen time possible".<ref name="Grimes 2023" /> For the ending, Nolan chose to make it intentionally vague to be open to interpretation and refrained from being didactic or conveying specific messages in his work. However, he did have the intention to present a "strong set of troubling reverberations at the end".<ref name="Ebiri-2023" />

=== Casting ===
''Oppenheimer'' marks the sixth collaboration between Nolan and Murphy, and the first starring Murphy as the lead.

It was also pointed out that the incorrect [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] was used. In the film, the current 50-star flag is shown. This version was not adopted until 1960.

In addition to their interpersonal conflicts, Strauss had another reason to undermine Oppenheimer's credibility by revoking his security clearance: Oppenheimer was opposed to further development of the [[hydrogen bomb]] by the United States. [[Scott Sagan]] describes the loss of Oppenheimer's influence as a possible constraint upon the [[nuclear arms race]] between the US and USSR as a "broader tragedy" less clearly depicted in the film than the scientist's personal tragedy but he called the production "highly accurate" otherwise for a Hollywood film.<ref>{{cite web |last1=De Witte |first1=Melissa |date=July 26, 2023 |title=Oppenheimer and the pursuit of nuclear disarmament |url=https://news.stanford.edu/2023/07/26/oppenheimer-pursuit-nuclear-disarmament/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230913025023/https://news.stanford.edu/2023/07/26/oppenheimer-pursuit-nuclear-disarmament/ |archive-date=September 13, 2023 |access-date=September 16, 2023 |website=Stanford News}}</ref>

Many efforts undertaken at other Manhattan Project sites like [[Hanford Site|Hanford, Washington]] and [[Manhattan Project#Oak Ridge|Oak Ridge, Tennessee]] were not shown.<ref name="Diaz-Maurin-2023" /> Most of them, overseen by General [[Leslie Groves]], focused on producing the radioactive material that powered the nuclear explosions.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gilinsky |first1=Victor |date=July 28, 2023 |title=Thought-provoked by 'Oppenheimer' |url=https://thebulletin.org/2023/07/thought-provoked-by-oppenheimer/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230806002301/https://thebulletin.org/2023/07/thought-provoked-by-oppenheimer/ |archive-date=August 6, 2023 |access-date=September 23, 2023 |website=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}</ref> In addition to the team at Los Alamos, those working at other Project sites, particularly the University of Chicago's [[Metallurgical Laboratory]], also expressed concerns about using the atomic bomb against Japan.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goldston |first1=Robert J. |date=August 17, 2023 |title=Widening the field of view on 'Oppenheimer' |url=https://thebulletin.org/2023/08/widening-the-field-of-view-on-oppenheimer/#post-heading |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927123002/https://thebulletin.org/2023/08/widening-the-field-of-view-on-oppenheimer/#post-heading |archive-date=September 27, 2023 |access-date=September 27, 2023 |publisher=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists}}</ref>

Another technical problem accurately represented throughout the film was plutonium production. This can be analyzed through the occurrence of discussions of [[Fizzle (nuclear explosion)|fizzle]], ingenuity, engineering breakthroughs and setbacks, and once again, the determination to succeed. The film focused on the great cost it took to obtain the plutonium, as well as the overall process of breeding plutonium. [[Enrico Fermi]], a main scientist involved in the [[Manhattan Project]], was the one who discovered that plutonium was the element necessary to produce a spontaneous fission reaction.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reed |first=Bruce |title=The Physics of the Manhattan Project |publisher=Springer |year=2014 |isbn=978-3-662-43533-5 |edition=third |location=Department of Physics Alma College, Alma Michigan, USA |publication-date=2014 }}</ref> His contributions to the Manhattan Project were not included in the film as much as they were recognized in real-life.

In the film, a scene depicts the May 31, 1945, meeting of the Interim Committee, which J. Robert Oppenheimer attended as a member of the Scientific Panel of consultants. In this scene, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson is portrayed ordering the removal of Kyoto from the list of top atomic bomb targets, allegedly because it was a favored honeymoon destination for him and his wife. However, historian of science and nuclear weapons, [[Alex Wellerstein]], clarifies that this portrayal is a myth. According to Wellerstein, Stimson's diary from his 1926 travels with his wife does not mention Kyoto, and the only brief visit they made there was in 1929, during a single night stay while on a "fact-finding" mission related to his role as [[Governor-General of the Philippines]]. The film's depiction overlooks that Stimson's objection to targeting Kyoto was primarily strategic rather than personal. He expressed this viewpoint to President Truman on multiple occasions, including at the [[Potsdam Conference]]. Stimson wrote in his diary on July 24, 1945, "He [Truman] again reiterated with the utmost emphasis his own concurring belief on that subject, and he was particularly emphatic in agreeing with my suggestion that if elimination was not done, the bitterness which would be caused by such a wanton act might make it impossible during the long post-war period to reconcile the Japanese to us in that area rather than to the Russians."<ref>{{cite web |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex |title=Henry Stimson Didn't Go to Kyoto on His Honeymoon |website=Nuclear Secrecy Blog |date=2023-07-24 |url=https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2023/07/24/henry-stimson-didnt-go-to-kyoto-on-his-honeymoon/ |access-date=2024-04-30 |archive-date=April 21, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240421001650/https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2023/07/24/henry-stimson-didnt-go-to-kyoto-on-his-honeymoon/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Wellerstein |first=Alex |title=The Kyoto Misconception |website=Nuclear Secrecy Blog |date=2014-08-08 |url=https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconception/ |access-date=2024-04-30 |archive-date=April 14, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240414075252/https://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2014/08/08/kyoto-misconception/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
